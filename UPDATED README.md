# TNBC Metabolic Strain Model
An open-source computational model of metabolic strain in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

## Overview
This project uses ODEs to simulate ATP and ROS dynamics in TNBC, testing a nanobiocomposite intervention in Google Colab. Gₜᵢₚ shifts from 0.238 to 0.245.

## Files
- `tnbc_model.ipynb`: Annotated Colab notebook with simulation and plots.
- `figure1.png`: ATP/ROS trajectories.

## Usage
1. Open `tnbc_model.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells to replicate results.
